# Analysis and Early Prediction of Sepsis using Clinical Data

Objective

Goal of the analysis is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data.

The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and we aim to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. 

Late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and also consumes heavy hospital resources.

By predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients consumes limited resources and we can assume the risk of prediction to be minimal but revolutionary.
